				<h2>steps</h2>
				<div>
					<div>
						<h4>preparing the eggs:</h4>
						<ol>
							<li>Separate the whites from the yolks, whisk the egg white until large bubbles form.</li>
							<li>Re-combine the whites and the yolks (if you separated them). Whisk again.</li>
							<li>Add the seasoning, quick whisk.</li>
						</ol>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h4>cooking in a wok:</h4>
						<ol>
							<li>
								First <i>longyau</i>: get your wok piping hot, to about steak searing temperature. Then shut off the
								heat and add in your oil – here we’re doing that two tablespoons of lard. Give it a good swirl so that
								you get a good distribution of lard, then toss that back over a high flame. Let it heat up a touch, ~30
								seconds or so or until you can see little bubbles forming around a pair of chopsticks when you put it in
								the lard (this equates to ~180C).
							</li>
							<li>
								Now drop in your egg. It will quickly puff up a bit. Grab your wok and move it off the flame. Now with a
								spatula scoop the cooked bits and lay them up to the side over your egg.
							</li>
							<li>
								Now put the wok back on the flame. Wait until little bubbles form around the edges. At that point, take
								the wok back off the flame and layer again.
							</li>
							<li>
								Continue through the motion until you have no more egg running off. The top will still look a bit gooey.
								This is the less cooked portion combining with the lard and forming a sort of ‘sauce’. It’s delicious,
								and what you want.
							</li>
						</ol>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h4>cooking in a non-stick pan:</h4>
						<ol>
							<li>
								In a non-stick skillet, first toss in the lard. Heat it up over a high flame til melted and bubbles form
								around a pair of chopsticks.
							</li>
							<li>Then add in the egg.</li>
							<li>
								After it puffs and sets, take the egg and pull it to one side of the pan. Then move your pan so that
								only the uncooked side is over the burner. Then once you start to see the bubbles, layer it over the
								cooked portion.
							</li>
							<li>
								Repeat until there’s no more egg, likely ~2 more times. This produced an egg that’s very similar to the
								wok version but a bit more spread out. To mimic the verticality then, you can sort of ‘cut’ the egg in
								half with your spatula, and lay one side over the other.
							</li>
						</ol>
