				<section>
					<h3>ingredients</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>4 chicken thighs, deboned</li>
						<li>2 tbsp honey + 1/2 tbsp hot water</li>
						<p>char-siu marinade:</p>
						<li>2 tbsp hoisin sauce</li>
						<li>1 tbsp light soy sauce</li>
						<li>1 piece of fermented bean curd</li>
						<li>1 tbsp Shaoxing cooking wine</li>
						<li>2 tbsp brown sugar</li>
						<li>2 tsp red food colouring (optional)</li>
						<li>2 tsp garlic salt</li>
						<li>1 tsp Chinese five spice powder</li>
						<li>1/2 tsp white pepper powder</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>steps</h3>
					<ol>
						<li>
							Debone the chicken thighs and make shallow cuts on the meat side to even out the thickness. This not only
							helps the chicken cook evenly but also allows the marinade to penetrate deeper, enhancing the flavor.
						</li>
						<li>
							Place the chicken into a zip lock bag and add the marinade sauce. Massage the meat with the marinade for a
							minute to ensure all parts of the chicken is well covered with the marinade.
						</li>
						<li>
							Press all the excess air out of the zip lock bag before sealing tight, and refrigerate and let it marinate
							overnight.
						</li>
						<li>
							To make the honey glaze, combine honey or maltose with hot water in a bowl, stirring until melted and
							smooth. Set the glaze aside.
						</li>
						<li>
							Preheat your air fryer to 195°C. Place the marinated chicken thighs, skin-side down and cook for 15
							minutes, flipping them halfway through. For a final char, brush the chicken skin with the honey glaze,
							increase the temperature to 200°C, and air-fry for an additional 2 minutes until the skin is crispy and
							caramelised.
						</li>
						<li>Once done, slice the chicken and serve it over rice with blanched pak choi. Enjoy!</li>

				<h2>cantonese style scrambled eggs, a.k.a. Whampoa fried eggs</h2>
				<img src="https://i.imgur.com/vIdI09y.jpg" alt="silken glistening layers of scrambled eggs" />
				<section>
					<h3>ingredients</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>5 medium eggs</li>
						<li>2 tbsp lard</li>
						<p>seasoning:</p>
						<li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
						<li>1/2 tsp sugar</li>
						<li>slurry of 1 tsp cornstarch + 1 tbsp water</li>
						<li>1/2 tsp Shaoxing wine</li>
						<li>1 tsp toasted sesame oil</li>
						<li>1/8 tsp white pepper powder</li>
						<li>1/8 tsp of MSG -or- chicken bouillon powder</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>steps</h3>
					<h4>preparing the eggs:</h4>
					<ol>
						<li>Separate the whites from the yolks, whisk the egg white until large bubbles form.</li>
						<li>Re-combine the whites and the yolks (if you separated them). Whisk again.</li>
						<li>Add the seasoning, quick whisk.</li>
					</ol>
					<h4>cooking in a wok:</h4>
					<ol>
						<li>
							First <i>longyau</i>: get your wok piping hot, to about steak searing temperature. Then shut off the heat
							and add in your oil – here we’re doing that two tablespoons of lard. Give it a good swirl so that you get
							a good distribution of lard, then toss that back over a high flame. Let it heat up a touch, ~30 seconds or
							so or until you can see little bubbles forming around a pair of chopsticks when you put it in the lard
							(this equates to ~180C).
						</li>
						<li>
							Now drop in your egg. It will quickly puff up a bit. Grab your wok and move it off the flame. Now with a
							spatula scoop the cooked bits and lay them up to the side over your egg.
						</li>
						<li>
							Now put the wok back on the flame. Wait until little bubbles form around the edges. At that point, take
							the wok back off the flame and layer again.
						</li>
						<li>
							Continue through the motion until you have no more egg running off. The top will still look a bit gooey.
							This is the less cooked portion combining with the lard and forming a sort of ‘sauce’. It’s delicious, and
							what you want.
						</li>
					</ol>
					<h4>cooking in a non-stick pan:</h4>
					<ol>
						<li>
							In a non-stick skillet, first toss in the lard. Heat it up over a high flame til melted and bubbles form
							around a pair of chopsticks.
						</li>
						<li>Then add in the egg.</li>
						<li>
							After it puffs and sets, take the egg and pull it to one side of the pan. Then move your pan so that only
							the uncooked side is over the burner. Then once you start to see the bubbles, layer it over the cooked
							portion.
						</li>
						<li>
							Repeat until there’s no more egg, likely ~2 more times. This produced an egg that’s very similar to the
							wok version but a bit more spread out. To mimic the verticality then, you can sort of ‘cut’ the egg in
							half with your spatula, and lay one side over the other.
						</li>
					</ol>

					alt="glass teapot pouring kadak chai into a ceramic cup next to an already filled ceramic cup" />
				<section>
					<h3>ingredients</h3>
					<p>serving for two:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>2 tbsp kadak chai mix of teas and spices</li>
						<li>6 tsp brown sugar (type of sweetener and amount adjustable based on preference)</li>
						<li>1 1/2 cup of water</li>
						<li>1 1/2 cup of milk -or- barista oat milk</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>steps</h3>
					<ol>
						<li>Add 1 1/2 cups of each water and milk to a saucepan. Then add two tablespoons of Kadak Chai.</li>
						<li>
							Bring to a boil and simmer for 3 to 5 minutes. Stir often, scraping the bottom of the pan to give your
							chai love and care, and to prevent sticking.
						</li>
						<li>
							Add sweetener to your liking. I recommend 2 to 3 tsp of sweetener per cup. Strain and serve. Give it a few
							minutes to cool down before you start sipping your chai.
						</li>
